 * @brief Performs categorical sampling on GPU with automatic clock-based seeding (FP16 version)

 * @param output Sampled indices [batch_size]
 * @param batch_size Number of probability distributions to sample from
 * @param vocab_size Size of each probability distribution
 * @param stream CUDA stream to launch the kernel on
 *
 * @note This function uses clock64() for seeding, providing non-reproducible randomness.
 *       Each call will produce different results even with the same input.
